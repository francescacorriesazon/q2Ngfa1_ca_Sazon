            So enchanting in every way.
            It's everlasting, every day.
            Sweet obsession, rose bouquets.
            Oh, it's heaven, or so they say.
            I wouldn't mind (ahh).
            I heard that falling fast is so divine.
            Are these songs just telling plain old lies?
            'Cause that's everything I know about love (ooh, ooh)
            Everything I know about love (ooh, ooh)
            I don't know that much at all.
            I trip, I fall.
            Every time I try, it's all too much.
            That's everything I know about love.
